# Wikipedia

Why wikipedia is ~~difficult to scrap~~ unique-

1. No standardization of tables
2. Merged columns
3. Merged rows
4. Embedded reference hyperlinks
5. No id or class based identifiers of different tables in an article

Wikipedia articles that I have scraped in this repo - 

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain_at_the_2020_Summer_Paralympics

Also, see the data collected section to see the output. I have outputted in CSV and Markdown.
