# Web to Table (Script collection / Cookbook)

## Introduction or Why am I doing this

In my [freelance](https://www.anyfactor.xyz/) web scraping and automation work, I do a lot of data scraping, data cleanup and structuring data.
Even though no two sites are the same....well that is not exactly true because isn't wordpress essentially the template of the internet.
Anyway.... many sites are not the same and capturing data from them is annoying and frustrating for most people except me.
So I will try my best to keep some of the scripts (recipes) I use in data cleanup.
But I do recognize the fact that there will come a website that isn't scrapable pragmatically so you HAVE to scrape the data manually or hire my VA firm to do that.

Enough advertisement.

## Things that I will use:

1. Python
2. Requests-html
3. Pandas

Some times I will use them but not often -

1. JSON (module)
2. Excel

## Example Sites:

1. Wikipedia
2. UK Government site: https://www.uksport.gov.uk/our-work/investing-in-sport/current-funding-figures
3. Another Table from the same, UK Government site: https://www.uksport.gov.uk/our-work/investing-in-sport/current-funding-figures
